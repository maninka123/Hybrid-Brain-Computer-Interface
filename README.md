# Hybrid Brain Computer Interface for Movement Control of Upper Limb Prostheses
This method is adapted by the paper published by Heba Ibrahim Aly, Sherin Youssef and Cherine Fathy to 2018 International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Applications (ICBEA) held in Portugal.<br>
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8471729 <br>
The proposed hybrid model consists of four phases that includes EEG & EMG data acquisition phase, pre-processing and segmentation phase, feature extraction and selection phase and Classification phase.
The Sample code for the experiment is uploaded to the GitHub.
